## 20230718_time

[Code](20230718_time/time.py)

Visualizing Unix time. The unix time is a date and time representation widley used in computing. It measures the time since the Unix epoch. This peaces are graphical representations of the Unix time values. Each time the script is run, it generates 16 time strips, the difference of time between each strip is randomized between 1 to 10 seconds. Then the colors are assigned based on the values of the time. The title of each image is the last time string that was captured.
